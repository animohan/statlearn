# Question 8

```{r}
college = read.csv("College.csv", header = TRUE)

# Look at the data
head(college)

# First column is the name of the college; Do not want R to treat this as data. 
# Use this first column and enter them as "row.names" of the row. This implies that R has given each row a name corresponding to appropriate university
rownames(college) = college[,1]
head(college)

#Now remove the first column
college = college[,-1]
head(college)

# Check dimensions
dim(college)

# Check type of variables
str(college)

# Using summary to produce numerical summary of variables
summary(college)

# Using pairs to plot scatter plot of first 10 variables
pairs(college[,1:10])

# Using plot to produce boxplots of Outstate vs Private
attach(college)
plot(Private, Outstate, xlab = "Private", ylab = "Outstate", main = "Private vs Outstate")


# Create a new qualitative variable :- Elite by binning Top 10 percent (Top10perc variable)
# Plan: Divide universities into 2 groups based on wheth;er proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school exceeds 50%

 Elite = rep("No", nrow(college)) # Create a vector of "No" with number of rows = nrow of college
 Elite[Top10perc > 50] = "Yes" # Yes for a university that has more than 50% students who were in top 10 percentile of thier class
 
 Elite = as.factor(Elite) # Treat Elite as a categorical variable
 college = data.frame(college, Elite) #Merge the data frames
 
 # Summary of the new Column "Elite"
 summary(college$Elite)
 
 plot(Elite, Outstate, xlab = "Elite", ylab = "Outstate", main = "Elite vs Outstate")
```


Histograms

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
hist(college$Apps, breaks = 15)
hist(college$Accept)
hist(college$Enroll, breaks = 15, xlab = "Enrollment", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Histrogam of Enrollment")
hist(college$Grad.Rate, breaks = 20)

```


# Question 9

```{r}
auto = read.table("Auto.data", header = TRUE)

#SUmmary of Auto
summary(auto)

# Checking if there are any is.na
summary(is.na(auto))

# Predictors that are qualitative or quantitative
str(auto)
# Predictors that are quantitative: mpg, Cylinders, displacement, weight, acceleration, year, origin.
# Predictors that are qualitative : horsepower, 

#Range of Quantitative 
quant = c("mpg","cylinders","displacement","weight","acceleration","year","origin")
for(c in quant){

#Mean and std deviation of each quantitative predictor
lapply(auto,mean)

  print(paste0("SD:",c,":",sd(auto[[c]])))
  print(paste0("Range:", c,":",range(auto[[c]])))

#Removing 10th to 85th observation and finding mean/sd
auto.sub = auto[-10:-85,]
lapply(auto.sub,mean)
lapply(auto.sub,sd)
lapply(auto.sub, range)
