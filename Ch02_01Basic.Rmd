```{r}
# Declaring a vector
 x <- c(1,2,3,4)

# Length of Vector
 length(x)

# Adding Vectors
 x = c(1,2,3)
 y = c(9,8,7)
 x+y
```

```{r}
# ls() function gives list of all the objects (data and functions)
 ls()
 
# Remove an objects
 rm(x)
 
# Remove all objects
 rm (list = ls())
```


```{r}
#Matrix Declaration
 x = matrix(data = c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) #Note entries go in each row for the same column first
 x
 
# Another way
 y = matrix(c(4,5,6,7,8,9), 2,3)
 y
 
# Entering the entries by each column first (per row)
 z = matrix(data=c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)
 z
```

```{r}
# Some simple functions: Square Root
 x = matrix(c(4,9,16,25),2,2)
 sqrt(x)
 
# Squaring values
 x = matrix(c(1,2,3,4),2,2)
 x^2
```


Random Values

```{r}
x = rnorm(50) # Random 50 values, with mean of 0 and std dev = 1
plot(x)

y = rnorm(50, mean=5, sd = 0.1) #50 values with mean around 5 and std dev = 0.1
plot(y)
```

Graphics:

```{r}
x = rnorm(100)
y = rnorm(100)
plot(x,y, xlab = "X-axis",ylab = "y-axis", main="Plot of X vs Y")

```

saving figures
```{r}
pdf("figure.pdf")
plot(x,y, col="green")
dev.off #Tells r that plot creation is done
```
